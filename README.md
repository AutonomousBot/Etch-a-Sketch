# Etch-a-Sketch

The goal of this project is to create a browser version of a sketchpad and an Etch a Sketch on a browser. Using DOM manipulation in html, we create a grid of 16x16 squares. When a user hovers over a square, that square is painted a new color. 

In the next phase of the project, we were asked to create a button which would reset the grid (removing colored grids) and prompt the user for a number of squares for the length of the grid. That same grid would have to fit in the same 960x960px space on the page. 

As an optional challenge, every time a user hovered over a blank square, the result would be a randomly colored square. If the square was already colored, it would get 10% darker every time the mouse passed by. So after 10 passes, the square became completely black.
